## Brave New World

Subtitle groups are indeed the open source movement and communist practice in literature world!

How do they make any money?

By the way, the series itself is totally shit, don't waste time on it.

## React

Ok, I give up Vue.js, I find that the reason why vue is so popular in China is just because its founder is a Chinese ( American Chinese ), but anyhow, whether react or vue is absolutely a big step for web-development, which means that what do you have learned previously is completely useless now( fuck! ).

This is a completely different way of developing the web. Besides, react has a killer feature: react native, which you could develop the web and bringing into a mobile app, you write it once and run in iOS and android. This is really cool!

But that makes it significantly harder, you can't master it in several days.
