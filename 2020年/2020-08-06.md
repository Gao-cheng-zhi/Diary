## Tag system

I deleted many books today, most of them are about iOS, and other books that in "download but never read" category.

I tagged the rest of them, now the download  folder is much clearer.

## 《The Effective Engineer ：How to Leverage Your Efforts In Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact》 by Edmond Lau

> I wanted to increase my impact, but working 70 to 80 hours per week to do it wasn’t sustainable. And so I searched for an answer that would let me work less and accomplish more.



Who says that is not sustainable? Look at what HUAWEI is doing.

……

Once you accept the ideal of: "Change my life by no-bottom-line competition", then chances are that you could experience it in every aspect of your life.

And the most horrific things is that in the end there is no way you can find to avoid it, just like there is almost no Internet companies are not 996, and no high schools don't apply the exam-oriented education.

And the "no-bottom-line competition" is quickly spread to the middle school and primary school.

Save our children!
