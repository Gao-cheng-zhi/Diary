## One Dream

Back to school, seat arrangement.

Teacher: According to the record, you have a basket history of misbehavior, including constant harass your classmates and ask irrelevant questions. Consider the fact that the lady behind you has announced official protest for letting you sit around, I give you a final warning: if there is anything unpleasant happened……

I: I am fully aware of the trouble my ignorant and frivolity have caused me, and I urgently ask that respectable lady to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf. I swear that everything I did was on the basis of sincerity and kindness, and if I inadvertently disturbed you, I deeply apologize for it.

After school, I walked through a culvert, there were thousands of birds flying around but not moving. 

Great chance to do some art.

I took out my phone and took some pictures, but camera app just don't work.

Walked outside the school, the school gate was blocked by a human wall constructed by thousands of migrant workers who had come to ask for their wages. 

It was terrible. 

They wouldn't give way, but they allowed students to walk over the heads of dead people they had brought in. Then we walked out the gate on the heads of thousands of dead people.



## Shandong

What's wrong with it? Negative news one by one?

Everything comes for a reason, Shandong is far from the most corrupted province in Zh.

I believe some big names are in trouble now.

## Final exam

The only way they think out to prevent plagiarizing is to ( dramatically ) increase the difficulty of test papers.

Which makes the hole test become a self-study ability test since nothing in the papers is ever teached.



## Night Walk

I used to buy my bread at the dinosaur park right in front of my house, but I changed to another shop today. 

It's a bit far, on the East Hanjiang Road, but this street is so strange, the density of the Japanese shops is just insane! Hundreds of Japanese food restaurants stacked almost one by one!
