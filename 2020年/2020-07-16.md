## Dreams

Taking an exam with my mom, riding, Many ghosts fly around the bike, When they coming near, I shout out my spell: "display:none"! And they disappear.

## Evernote

How did its clipboard plugin get so intelligent? I was shocked by its automatic detection, it automatically move the ranger doc
into "command-line tool" folder and css doc into "前端" folder, that means it actually know what my folder's name means and what the doc is talking about!
