## Two dreams

1. Bought a ￥899 Armani pants from  a flea fair, go to school canteen for lunch, lost.

2. Boring single lens dream: but can't remember, sort of something like phone or software.

Pass the register exam just for the free 4K film. ( So how did they make any money? )

Most of the questions are pretty easy, don't think it can really screen out the real anime fans.

And the time limit is loose, I think they just don't want lazy guys to come in.



## *Data structures and Algorithms illustrated* by jay Winglow

Really good books, there are several shining points that make this book stand out, but the most significant one is: this book primarily focuses on the fundamental principle rather than the trivial implementation.

You know that many books don't even tell you how ram works before he started to construct a multiple crossed linked list, which my textbook does, WTF!

So I barely learned nothing in my data structure class last year, I just forced myself to remember those C language code and write them on the examination papers. 

Thanks god, fair good points in the end.

Another good thing about this books is that the writing style of the author is astonishing concise, it's only 174 pages, can you image that? It's even shorter that the LSD book I read yesterday, Obviously that doesn't mean that you could finish reading this book in about a lunch time, but not so longer.

## Docker

Tooooo many things to learn!

## Learning web design

Entering the js part, search on ZHIHU, they usually say it is too trivial to learn, and the very basic entry-level book is about 800 pages long, OMG!

Find a good place to download audiobooks which are recorded by volunteers around the world free of copyright: http://www.loyalbooks.com/ & https://librivox.org/

It's so moving!

The world of the Internet has pioneered the practice of communism! 

The only payment is for VPN that breaks through the firewall that set by a communist country.

How ironic!
