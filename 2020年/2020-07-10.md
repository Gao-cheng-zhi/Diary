## One dream

One of my friends came from France to spend her summer vacation in China, we were planned to take some photos in an abandoned train station.

She says French workers are very well paid. Would I be interested in working in France? (as railroad workers, like switchers)

I expressed my concern that my French might be a big obstacle. ( which I don't know any )

Another friend of mine bragged that in their railway tax office. The wage is much higher than the average wage in France. ( which they are able to dispose of intercepted illegal goods at their please. )

I was curious about what he said and asked him a few technical questions about the details of implementation.

At that time, I accidentally dropped my AirPods and broke it. I realize I had less than ï¿¥200 in my wallet and I couldn't live without it.

Awake.
