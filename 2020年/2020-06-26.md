## Some dreams

1. After school, invite some girls to have dinner, discuss what to eat, bullfrog pot、barbecue、DongBei stewed pot ad so on.

   While we were eating, I noticed that I miss the English listening test online, so I leave for the toilet and begin to do the listening test. It's about 3 minutes, the content of the dialogue is a drone takes off shortly before the carrier is destroyed, but suffers collision damage, leading to its defection. It's very similar to a science fiction movie I saw when I was a kid, but I've forgotten the name. 

   But that's not the point. The point is that while I was listening, there was a war going on outside the window.

   You can't imagine how intense it was. Two Boston-powered robot dogs run up first, a group of men shoot at them, then suddenly a team of giant tanks crashes in then explode. By this time the fire was so intense that a hundred thousand shells were fired in almost two seconds. 

   I was terrified of the flames and smoke in my field of vision, but instantly I remembered to take out my iPhone to shoot this amazing things. But when I back to the table, all the images are gone, it's deleted by FBI already!

2. Using an old small TV as external monitor to program a jQuery affair, it was FUCKING boring!!!
