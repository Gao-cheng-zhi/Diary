## 整理

最近重看薛定谔的《生命是什么》，如果说生命从有序走向无序的过程是必然的，那么我的印象笔记也是这样。

早上在收藏一篇文章的时候，我实在无法容忍这种杂乱无序的分类状态（几乎所有文章都堆积在摘抄和swift下面，因为那是两个自动分类的默认笔记本。）就决心做了一下分类。

顺带回顾了一下，发现很多有趣的文章堆积在历史的垃圾堆桶里面，根本就没有看过。而很多看过的非常有趣的文章已经忘记了。

当然还有很多毫无用处又不是很有趣的文章，大概删了50多条。

## The C Re A People’s History, 1962-1976 by Frank Dikotter 

> He asked that everyone emulate his wife, and take part in the campaign by joining work teams in the countryside: ‘Hurry and go!’ Those who declined, he insinuated, were not fit to serve on the Politburo. The whole performance took less than an hour. On their way out, many leading officials wondered what had just happened. ‘What the hell was that? Were we being lectured?’, some of them muttered. Several army officials cursed Liu under their breath. They did not like taking orders from anyone but the Chairman, and they certainly did not appreciate how Liu publicly promoted his own wife.

爱妻狂魔？？？然后我去查了一下，结果他有六个老婆！

> uring the Socialist Education Campaign conducted by Liu Sq, over 5 million party members were punished, with more than 77,000 people hounded to their death. The vast majority were innocent, and many of these verdicts were overturned in the 1980s. Liu pushed through one of the longest and most vicious purges of party members in the history of the PRC.

四清这段历史好像没人知道啊。。。

## 中國史  第六卷 「砸爛舊世界」──文化大RE的**與浩劫（1966-1968） by 卜偉華

还是年轻人破坏力大呀！说不定老龄化社会是全球安定的一剂良方呢。

这种发了狂的崇拜和理想主义，现在应该是不会有了。

但是可能有更可怕的东西替代它。

猫讲话真的很奇怪呀！他满口的freedom, democracy, protest，然后做着完全相反的事，关键是他从来都没有露出破绽过，到底是他内心太强大还是他本来就是这么想的？

## Beginning ARKit for iPhone and iPad Augmented Reality App Development for iOS by Wallace Wang

听说原本今年下半年，最后推迟到明年初，就要推出apple glass 了。我父亲表示这样的东西完全做不出来，更别提让世界另外一半不戴眼镜的人天天戴上眼镜了。

下了一点swift 和iOS 的书，哎呀，我放在积压区的书真是堆积如山，真是看到结婚都看不完了！

我真想休学两年，在家埋头把要看的书全部看掉。

但想了想，我现在不也就算是处在休学状态吗？问题不是没有时间，而是自己太懒，效率、行动力和专注度糟糕透顶。

要抓紧时间啊！
