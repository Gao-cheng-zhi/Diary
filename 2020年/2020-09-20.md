## 《尼禄法令》

和前几天那个帖子有异曲同工之处。。。

不太理解，既然已经输了为什么还要管后事？

## 甲骨文

哈哈哈，微软最终和移动端失之交臂！

但是说实话，除非他卖给像Facebook推特这样的公司。否则抖音实在是和这些美国公司价值观不太相符呀。

甲骨文这种养老企业真正能经营好产品吗？

## 优衣库

来的时候没想到秋天会来的那么快。

没啥好看的，有几件不错但是布料太差了。

## 沙甸事件

有意思，多少历史无人知晓啊。

## 196x

最近练车阅读进度飞快。

昨天还在读5·16 今天🐈就死了。

> Luo Ruiqing, one of the first leading officials to have become a victim of the CRevolution, insisted on attending the funeral in his wheelchair. He still adored the man who had persecuted him, and he cried.



太感动了，这就是斯德哥尔摩效应吗？简直就是SM啊！

> Many students grew up in sheer ignorance of the most basic physiological facts. Zhuo Fei, for one, was terrified that she might become pregnant after sharing a bicycle with a young man, but she was too afraid to ask anybody, even her own relatives. Rae Yang, the Red Guard from Beijing who had relished the opportunity to go to Manchuria, put it in a nutshell: We did not have sex or even think about it. Sex was bourgeois. No doubt about it! In my mind, it was something very dirty and ugly. It was also extremely dangerous. In the books I read and the movies I saw, only the bad guys were interested in sex. Revolutionaries had nothing to do with it. When revolutionaries fell in love, they loved with their hearts. They didn't even touch hands.'

> But like so many other students banned to the countryside, Rae learned quickly by watching the farm animals. 
>
> She was put in charge of breeding boars,having to guide their quivering genitals into a sow's vagina. 'It was like watching pornographic movies day in and day out.' Others found out by reading The Heart of a Maiden. 



这。。。太过分了吧，分配给女学生母猪配种的工作。不过好在猪的🐓🐓长得很抽象，很难和那玩意儿形成联想。

The Heart of a Maiden 曼娜回忆录，是cr期间阅读数量排第三的书，第一的是《语录》，第二是《新华字典》。

这让我想起了法国大革命前法国排前十的畅销书。其中有《社会契约论》、《论法的精神》、？。其余七本都是黄书，不过那些也不是完全只有性交情节，它们大多数蕴含着对封建伦理和宗教约束的反叛。

> Everyone awoke at the whistle at 3.30 in the morning. Nobody wanted to lag behind, fearful of being accused of not supporting Chairµån Måø. Everyone’s performance was recorded, and those at the bottom of the scale were denounced in public struggle meetings.



这种增长模式就很疑惑。你说某一年大干一场把生产力提上去也就算了，但这些东西都是长期的规划，每年都要比上一年还要增加。这增加到最后人怎么受了？奴隶制也没有这么野蛮的。

> Senseless and unpredictable purges were designed to cow the population and rip apart entire communities, producing docile, atomised individuals loyal to no one but the Chairµån .

看里面农民是最可怜：明明啥也不懂，字都不识，每回都被整的半死不活，动不动就因为抓捕指标变成“counter revolution”，实在是想不明白为什么有些毛左想要回到这种生活。
