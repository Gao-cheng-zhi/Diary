## No dream

Actually insomnia.

## Pittance

I was listening Pittance from the album *Maths* and I happened to think about that:

The funniest thing about 曹学 or 入关学 is that the supreme pursuit of human civilization has turns out to be "Big House"& "Eat Steak", Excuse me??? WTF???

Some people may say, well, spiritual pursuit is important, but my life do get really hard if I don't have a big house right now. 

Come on, that's not because you don't have a big house, okay?

That is because you live in a society that is hostile to people who don't have big houses , a society where relatively poor people (which is the majority) have no sense of dignity in any case.

> You don't  choose from rich or poor, you choose from rich or miserable.

People don't believe in love and tolerance, trampling each other madly and discriminating against each other in any possible field. And 曹学家 think all these shit things could be simply repaired with a big house???

That reminds me of the *big steel-making* in 1958. The chåirmån is so keen on the increase of steel production. He issued a call to *overtake Britain within three years*. The symbol of overtaking The UK is not in anything else, but in steel production. What can that fucking dark ring of iron do? Even if all today's steel production were transported to Chinå in 1958, would that Chinå suddenly become the greatest country in the world?

## 国の歴史的ユー⑤佗蜯運動−big岄進からbig🐔饉へ(1958−1961)

（I found that replacing a to å and c to ç is completely useless, hope this could cheat the auto detect systems.）

I had lost all my interest in national history series because the previous book, 1966 one, was so badly written( and not pc ). However, the description of 钢铁直男錋㥁徊 in Huang Zhangjing's article successfully aroused my great curiosity to see what happened in the Lshan Meeting.

I had expected that to be a heroic or idealistic anti-authority tragedy in which a traditional loyalist dared to speak his mind. But when I read it, I found it was completely different.

Actually, although I know it is unfair to say so, but on the surface, I even get a little angry about PDh. I think he completely transformed the history of our country, a place where we could have gone to be better, but he turned it into a hell.

Before the Lshan meeting, 🐈 had made several southern tours to figure out what happened. He knew that the so-called high production was all lie to him, and because of the series of lies, excessive grain impose and the loss of labor to make steel have caused widespread famine.

（By the way, three years of natural disasters is a complete sham, even if you take the current grain production capacity of Israel and put it in 国 at that time, it would also cause famine, because the year before the famine, people were actually talking about what if there was too much food to eat?!!）

The Lshan meeting was supposed to be against the left. The meeting was used to fraternize with other 排队领袖. To find a solution to the left, but a letter from Pdh completely changed the course. 🐈 was so angry, cursed on the meeting for entirely three hours.

So does he in his letter showed a betrayal of 🐈 ?

In fact, there was no difference between what he said in his letter and what other leaders had said at the meeting, except that he had used the word "petty-bourgeois". The rest, believe me, is even too humble.

Then PDH was isolated, LShao⑦, Zou摁徕, also began to slander him crazily, all kinds of people have framed him without any principle.

国 was embroiled in the endless 怔炙 battles again, all people against all people. Only 稻 survived in the end and save us from becoming 曹. You know that could happened by plan.
