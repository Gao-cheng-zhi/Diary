## Dream

1. J died, the whole country is mourning for him. His mourning hall is spectacular, very holy, white cloth flies everywhere. At the same time, the famous architect 隈研吾 also died, but few people mourn for him, the mourning hall is very small but clean ( designed by himself )

2. Eating watermelon with my dad. Ironically I hate eat it in reality.

3. Married a young girl with yellow hair. She is very pretty with nice figure. We meet at her grocery one afternoon, She was busy unloading the truck, but the potatoes fell all over the ground. I came over to help her pick them up. 

   In reality, there is indeed a yellow-haired saleswoman in the grocery store downstairs. But she was neither young nor pretty, thus I had no interested on her. Ah, vulgar man!

4. Write a play, spent too much time on making props (which is a gun), give up in the end.

## 《Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous A tutorial introduction to the Unix command line》by Michael Hartl

Really really good, It is simple and clear, even my mother could read it.

It is very short, only 78 pages long. 

This book is for absolute beginner, it even teaches you how to find "|". If you have some background, you could finish it in 2~3 hours. Obviously such tiny book would not cover every things about CLI, but it is a very good place to start.



## 郑成功
