## Deam

B-2 bombing.

Using vim to operate an anti-aircraft gun.

Obviously useless.

## 《Data structure and algorithm》

There is a print error on P175, chapter sort, the "ElementType" was printed as "Element Type"

## React

Ok, I switch to another course, despite the previous one had a bald teacher, but actually he seems not good at teaching, we spend hours building a react app ( start from scratch ) I guess he pretended all his audiences are ES7 and TypeScript experts, unfortunately I totally knew few about it. So one hour later( Two hours in all ), I was already unable to catch up on it. 

The current course is from www.freetutorial.us, but the teacher is a Russian ( slightly heavy accent ), he spend the first 45 minutes to introduce the react architecture and the next gen js ( ES7 ), which is very nice. 

The shortage is this course has 400 episodes, which is kind of too detailed, I use 2x to go through it, but his Russian accent make it bit hard to understand what he says.



## ToDo List

I always like the default todo app on Ubuntu. It is simple, beautiful and elegant.

I plan to take it into iOS( maybe universal App in the future ) using the brand new SwiftUI, start from today.

But it seems getting off on the wrong foot.

Oh, too many syntaxes changed from last year, I may have to relearn the declarative syntax tomorrow.
