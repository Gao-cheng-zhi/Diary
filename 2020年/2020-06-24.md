## One dream

Music class, being asked to sing the famous *Largo al factotum*, success.

Awake, trying to recall how I did it, search on the Netease, follow it, failed.

It's too hard! 

## Twitter says staff can continue working from home permanently

> When your tech company starts doing mass telecommuting, guess what your developers will end up like?

> Indians, Ukrainians, Poles, Filipinos, and Egyptians……

> For the same front-end development, the external price in Europe may be 1,000 euros a day, while in India it may be 300 dollars.

> It's all remote, Poles and Ukrainians are cheap, And Egyptians are just unreasonably cheap.

Oh fuck! Egyptians!

> Programmers in China are, in fact, already very expensive. After telecommuting in the industry as a whole, What will Tencent choose?  Those who earn a million yuan per year in China or those who earn 50,000 yuan in Eastern Europe?

They don't speak Chinese!

But who cares?

## Gacha Games https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvdtJsZpuQ4

I never thought these things actually got it physical version in Japan.....

Despite I despise such business practice, but no doubt that it set the spring of illustrator industry.

What else way can one hentai artist make decent money in China?

This video is really interesting.

**I hope every one could see this**. **Then break your child/partner's legs when they're about to step in.**

OMG！

This guy attacks illegal websites in China like gamble website, and ask them for money to get their websites work, and he earned ￥7 million a year!

But according to the www.nationalcrimeagency.gov, attack an illegal site in any cases is actually illegal.

The only exception is that when you are hired by a police......
