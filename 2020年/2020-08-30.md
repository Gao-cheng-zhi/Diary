## 梦



1. 羞辱、背叛和悔过。

   宿舍三人组成的正义联盟一个接着一个被老流浪汉手中那把无限锋利的小刀杀害了：只要轻轻碰到你一下，身体里的血液就会全部流干。

   在天堂饭店里，我们反复逼问那位最有嫌疑的同学，最终他嚅嗫着说道：

   > 基因里有非编码基因和构建蛋白质的编码基因，非编码基因有三种：AAT和~~……
   >
   > 

2. 杀死了自己的父亲和一个哥哥（并不存在），从此变成了通灵师。

   十多年后，当我再回到村里时，三位长得一模一样的哥哥（并不存在）问我父亲和哥哥过得怎么样，我回答：

   > 他们相处的还不错

## 《196X~》

> Beijing was stretched to breaking point. At the peak of the campaign there were 3 million visitors in the city on top of a permanent population of 7.7 million. Food was commandeered from the surrounding countryside to feed the capital. Chaos set in.One rebel worker , arriving from Shanghai at the offices of the powerful All-China Trade Union in the middle of the winter, was shocked when he saw the floors covered in rubbish and a flow of excrement, frozen solid by the cold. He wondered: What is this? Is this hell or hallowed revolutionary ground?"
>
> The Red Guards complained, but none apparently spared a thought for the cleaners-referred to in communist parlance as the'proletariat'-who had to sort out the mess, forced to plunge their arms down toilets to unblock the sewage. In Shanghai the situation was made worse by visitors who were unfamiliar with sitting toiletsand squatted on them instead. When several cleaners refused to carry on, complaining that the stench made them vomit, they were told that what stinks is not so much the excrement as your own ideology.



噗，what stinks is not so much the excrement as your own ideology.
