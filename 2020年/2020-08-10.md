## Dream

Using VScode api to write a text editor.

But when I got up, I start to realize that is ridiculous, since VScode itself is already a text editor.



## 牛津通识读本

Dad: "I plan to start reading today!"

I: "Oh, that is a big news."

D: "Have you ever read the *增广贤文*, what about that?"

I: "That is for kids, you should read some more advanced. I will give you a link, you can pick one of them you like"

D: "Oh, I'll buy the *科学哲学*."

I: "That is too advanced, you won't understand it."

D: "Who says that, I will buy it anyway."
