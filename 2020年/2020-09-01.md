## New month!

Many tasks, very busy.

Half of the courses are about statistics.

I hate statistics! Barely failed in last year's elementary statistics class.

## Dream

Feast, Japanese food, beautiful ladies.

Never eat anything in the dream!



## Polyamory

> One interesting thing is that polygamy can get more sexual satisfaction than open relationships.



So group sex is more exciting than cheating？

Anyway, I just can't accept those propositions about multiple couples. My reasons are all old Christian doctrine: people should not  indulge in pleasure nut to achieve transcendence ,etc.

But if you consider your life a limit set and hold the ideal of nihilism, there is really no reason not to enjoy sensual as much as possible.





## New version of VSCode

OMG VSCode supports sync settings now!

I have been using vim to write the basic CS homework for past few months, but I still think the VSCode the most convenient way to get a quick start: you just install some Plugins and there you go.

Plus: Vim-Plugin in VSCode  is even faster that the native vim in shell.

## Accumulation

Seeing the beautiful lady in front of me integrating mountains of review material and spending the whole day in the library jumping through Math, English, Physics and eventually tired to pour on the desk at about 5pm.

This really makes me think that: Why don't we teach our child abstract algebra and other things like that at day one? Otherwise they will pay so much for their ignorance when they grow up.
