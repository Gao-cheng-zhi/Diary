# 2020-07-22

## Insomnia

Oh fuck! Must go to bed 11:00 and read Wittgenstein's books before sleep, start from today!

Or I maybe die of it!

## 《data structure and algorithm》

Finally finished the tree part.

I find that many things that I thought difficult previously are actually not that difficult. 

In most cases, it's just because we are too lazy to read the doc.

## React

Now I can kind of understand why they teaches us those old-school ways of developing the web.

Because this world is full of those shit web pages!

React is like an ICBM, you don't ever need to use ICBM to conquer an Africa country, they don't deserve it, simply use AK-47! It's much cheaper.

There are only a few websites in the world that need such a powerful framework to build. Most websites are just a simple ad page with no data to change.
