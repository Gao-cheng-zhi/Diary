## 如何看待武汉科协回应 2 名小学生研究茶多酚抗肿瘤获奖：学生能够独立完成实验，并按照程序申报？

WOW, This guy is awesome ! 

I knew his name several months ago, being reported by “饶毅”.

But this is weird. As we all know there are two kinds of big names: Those who are too big to be put on the media and those who are not too big to put on the media.

To the first kind nobody knows what happened or dares to know what happened, however the second kind, once be reported, It's basically a sentence to death to them.

This guy is the third kind: We dare to know what happened but can do nothing about it. 

……

So why so many academic scandal been exposed recently? Is it another against the rightism?
