## Kindle

I found that the dictionary function in kindle is very powerful.

It creates a perfect workflow for learning English: reading, looking up words, collecting fresh words, reviewing……all in one place and you can do it very fast.

The only drawback is that it lacks a pronunciation feature.

## Calendar

Still the best way to manage your schedule, but I have too many tasks to do...
