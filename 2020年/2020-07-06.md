## One dream

One of my friends fell in love with a girl.

I meet him in a library on the fourth floor（The first floor is a vegetable market, the second one is a book center, like Xinhua Bookstore, the third floor is empty with only concrete walls and concrete floors, so why this building is a library?）

On the fourth floor, where many tramps were lodging, he ran down with a pillow and books in his arms. ( In reality, he does often live in the library instead of sleeping in the dormitory. Because he was an intern in the school's software development team, he had his own small space in the library, which was very quiet and spacious.）

I asked：what are you doing?

He：I'm following a beautiful girl. I met her the other day and fell immediately in love with her.

I：Love makes people fool, Let me see what kind of fairy girl has you in her thrall.

I don't remember what happen next.

## Bootstrap

Well, the grid system is really nice!

I plan to make a AppleMusic-like NeteaseMusic website when I finished learning it.

## The new secretary

The new pårty secretåry of Changzhou arrived today, bringing 100 billion RMB in development funds.

The slogan is a plan that builds the new city.

One of the buildings to be built is a Changzhou version of *Marina Bay Sands*

But instead of 3 cols, it has 4 cols.

## 1.2.4.8

Fuck！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！

Now I know why it takes less that 1s to get on Google but 10s on average to search anything on Baidu……

I set the DNS to 8.8.8.8 ( Google DNS ) last year, it works perfectly fine in school, but when I got back home I feel like Safari is broken because it almost doesn't work. 

I switch to Chrome, ok, 10s to search things on Baidu.

And it's getting slower and slower.

iPhone's network settings may be automatically synchronized with my Mac, so it create a unified user experience.

But when I uses my mom's HUAWEI MatePad to watch some videos today, it feels amazing smooth!

OMG it must be the DNS problem! I switch to 1.2.4.8, OMG Safari runs like a beast!

The large format looks just gorgeous...
