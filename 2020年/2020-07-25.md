## Pixiv

It seems that the pandemic has boosted the artists' creativity.

Haven't viewed it for a few weeks, the artists on my list have created tons of new paintings.

This reminds me that in this world there are still some beautiful things deserve our love and wisdom.

Fuck, I wonder if those war mongers and anti-human keyboard politicians have ever seen such beautiful things, how could their dare to destroy that?

While I also notice that, due to the passive censorship police Pixiv has conducted, some of the R-18 contents have obviously reached the baseline of human civilization. I am not a staid conservative, You know that even pornographic websites have their own censorship system, because some of the content is unacceptable to all civilized people.

The vague description of child pornography in Japanese animation has always been a loophole in its legitimacy. But I am OK with that. In western views, all Japanese anime has child pornography, which is obviously unreasonable.

But what I'm talking about is some of the most violent and bloody content in Pixiv. They obviously violated the laws of any country in this world. As far as I know, some popular artists have been arrested by the FBI, but Pixiv always refused to impose any restrictions on their content. 

By the way, the COMI has imposed an unprecedented high-level blockade on Pixiv, you can't get access to it even with VPN.
