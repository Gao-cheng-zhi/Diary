## Dream 

It's a triple loop, the third loop is a traditional middle school scene, I was in that classroom, again.

"Would you please do me a favor?" My physics teacher asked.

"About what?" I asked back.

"There is English demonstration lesson right away, I would like you to cooperate with me to answer some simple questions and do some interactive dialogue. " He says

Well, obviously, since I graduated from middle school, my English skills has been greatly improved, compared to those kids.

I believe there is no difficulties to deal with such level of work, which is not a painful thing at least. Besides, he used to be physics my teacher, how can I refuse such small favor?

I :"Ok."

Monitor: "Now it is time for the 23rd random physics exam before the High school Entrance Examination!, everyone gets ready!"

I :"WTF? What is it? Can I just go and come back before the English class? It's impossible for me to write a single line of physics right now."

Monitor:" No way! Everyone is the same."

I :"Fuck, I will leave now."

……

Then I leave the third loop, It's 3:00 pm, I don't know that is a dream, I called the monitor at the third loop and from the TV camera I saw "myself"  in the class perfectly finished the exam, them I go back to the third loop to start my show.

Contrary to what I expected, It was not a English Class, it is a VIM class ( WTF??? )

But that doesn't matter, because in my recent training as a front-end engineer, my VIM level is already very high ( just bragging ).

I can't imagine how I used a mechanical keyboard that fast, even in real life, and my hands on the keyboard are bouncing like a spider spinning a web.

……

Then I back to the second loop, it is already 7:00.

Oh fuck, don't tell me I sleep till night!

I tapped my Apple Watch. It's actually 7:00 am, so it's not too late, but I remember the last nap I took was a mid-afternoon nap...

It's weird, I want to get up, and then I fall into the first loop, which is the reality, 8:00 in the morning.

Then I write this diary.

## Tik Tok

> Pension Partners首席投资战略师盖耶德认为，封杀TikTok很可能让特朗普输掉大选。“千禧一代不能盲目地通过跳舞、制作视频浪费时间，一定会感到很无聊，他们没有其他事可做，只好站出来投票给拜登。”

Ho ho, Now we know who will vote to Biden.

Well I don't know if you guys have read the books *The Room Where It Happened A White House Memoir by john Bolton*

These key decisions between our two countries have been carefully discussed by phone with the top leaders before and after the implementation, so as a matter of practice, "HE" probably knew about it and may have acquiesced to trump's actions.

Many people on the Internet think That Mr. Zhang quickly surrendered without negotiating with our government for protection. Do you think he is a sb like you? Or has he never lived in China for a single day?

Another possibility is that the current online bluffers are simply paid "水军" to suppress Tik Tok, is that you, KuaiShou?

……

Of course, if people boycott Tik Tok because of nationalism. Then it would be of great benefit to the physical and mental health of our nation, which of course is impossible：

"千禧一代不能盲目地通过跳舞、制作视频浪费时间，一定会感到很无聊，他们没有其他事可做。"



## 《De Profundis》

Oh shit, his language is astonishing beautiful!

Why this book is not in popular？homosexual？

Everyone should read this, it teaches us what is so called "decent".



## KOEKKOEK

Very interesting.

His work tells us that the color of film can never be imitated electronically.

So sad.
