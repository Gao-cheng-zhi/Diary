## 《Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.》

> But immediately afterward I noticed that, while I wanted thus to think that everything was false, it necessarily had to be the case that I, who was thinking this, was something. And noticing that this truth—/ *think, therefore I am*—was so firm and so assured that all the most extravagant suppositions of the skeptics were incapable of shaking it, I judged that I could accept it without scruple as the first principle of the philosophy I was seeking.

老经典了，但是和之前想的不一样，没那么多铺垫，看来解释都是后人生成的。

对 perfection 的理解变得非常重要。

每天读它花的时间太多了，主要是读得太慢。

太可惜了，我原以为一个人只要恋爱了，通常不会做这种自我毁灭的事情，事实上也不一定，亲密关系有时候不会让人敞开心扉。
