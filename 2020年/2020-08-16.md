## Backup

Heard a bad news from a friend who lost his entire data from his SSD. 

I decide to back up my computer now.

I write an automatic tool to help me synchronize the setup.


## tmux

Why those great tools all have that stupid default key setting???

Ridiculous, ctrl + b???

I know everyone sets it into ctrl +x, but why don't we make that into default setting?

## Ali Cloud

Fuck, really hard to use its website to manage something.
