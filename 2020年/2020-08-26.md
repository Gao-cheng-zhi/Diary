## Lorin Maazel Essentials

开幕雷击！

## Britain plans to retire all its tanks

The decline and fall of the British Empire！

It seems that Europe really doesn't have many tanks and most of then are made from Germany.

Once Germany falls, no one can make tanks anymore.

## Back to school tomorrow!!!

Anxiety, Inexplicable anxiety.



Read books of Krishnamurti, can't read, no help.

Go to Pornhub, more anxiety: everyone has sex in college except me. no help.

Listen to Edvard Grieg's Music to help me relax, Music is always the Savior!

Catch the train at 6 am tomorrow morning, have to go to bed early tonight.
