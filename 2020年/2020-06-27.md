## No Dreams today

emm...actually have one, but too boring.

## Apple Watch 

When the first generation of AW came out, lve was invited to World Economic Forum, he says the Apple Watch's lifespan was designed to be about one year, so it won't hurt luxury watches.

I think what he says is true when I have to charge it everyday now ( compared to charging it every three days when I first bought it )
