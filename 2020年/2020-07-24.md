## ToDo list

The most fucking thing about app development is that you don't know what challenge you're going to meet. 

When I started, everything seems easy to be built, but when you actually do it in details, all kinds of problems emerged, it is even possible you can never solve them.

So I never believe children in "青少年创新大赛" could develop their own App, that must be cheating.

Aaaaah fuck, I'm a bug generator! 

There is tons of problems in swiftUI, I really shouldn't use this new framework to build App. Frankly speaking, they all bluff that swiftUI is "revolutionary" 、"10 times easier to build an app", but I don't feel that...

OK, The framework is basically in place, but this is ugly and featureless, I may draw a real paperclip instead of this SF symbol
