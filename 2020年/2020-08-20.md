## Discuss on open relationship

### Preface

I read an [article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZzeE5NgNdsxMPpFan9wr7g) about open relationship this morning.

Honestly, I am still kind of shocked about this concept, although I have read the related concepts discussed long before.

That is in a lecture given by Zizek, he discussed some moral issues about open sexual relations. But I think he's just plainly talking about it. For an old and fat ugly guy like Zizek, it's hard to find any satisfying sexual relationship, I guess.

May be a bit of long and messy, so I made an index.

如果你不想看英文，我会把机翻的文章链接放在最后面。你可能会问，我的天哪，那你干嘛要用英文写这么个长篇大论呢？

老天才知道，我原本只想写一小段英文评论作为写作练习，但是后来越写越长，最后我发现没人愿意读下去，但是删掉用中文重写就太可惜了。

### My sexual experience

No doubt, I almost have no sexual experience. 

Although I have been exposed to pornography ( Most of them are novels and pics ) at a very young age ( Thanks the internet ), I always appreciate them as works of art and cultural products. In this case, the plot and the meaning of the expression are the most important part, and the ultimate goal is not to ejaculate. 

At that time, I thought that sex had an irreplaceable status in human life, and the suppression of sex was very anti-humane, stereotyped and unreasonable. 

But after I started to masturbate ( one years ago ), my attitude towards sex took a 180-degree turn.

( Well, you may wonder, why did you start masturbating so late? Most teens already have their first sexual behavior at your age. And the even more weird thing is that you said you were exposed to pornography so early, but you have never masturbated. That is simply incomprehensible.

In fact, sometimes things are indeed so weird. In all the pornography I saw, none of them describe how men masturbate. 

Of course, this matter is never taught by others. There are some views point out that people are born with a certain impulse and that impulse will guide you through all the steps.

Another very important reason is that I was born with a serious blood disease. In the chapter of *sex and death* in that disease manual, it says:

> There is a saying: Pain is the best contraceptive. Of course, this is not always that case. 
>
> People with XXX disease can still have normal sex under the guidance of a doctor.
>
> You should strictly follow the following rules:
> 1. Inject XXXml of XXX sterol products intravenously one hour before sex. The exact content of the XXX sterol product is calculated according to the formula specified in Appendix III.
> 2. Try to avoid intense sexual activity and excessive pressure on the heart.
> 3. If chronic pain affects your erection, take painkillers in advance.
>
> etc



So even though I had a few marginal masturbation behaviors, when I was approaching orgasm, I always felt that it was too intense, so that my sanity had the upper hand and told me that I had to stop.

Of course, after I was old enough, I found that was no problem at all. The booklet was bluffing. )

### My opinion on masturbating

When I started to masturbate,  along with the great pleasure, as the tide of desire subsided, goes the philosophical introspection about my previous sex opinions.

In a word, the desire and pleasure we felt are totally unreasonable and ridiculous. I hate this.

This is just a mechanism designed by God in our genes. It has no meaning nor it contains any meaning, you just press a button on your dick and you go orgasm. 

This is meaningless and a waste of time, but people only realize it after they get orgasm. And few days later, he will continue the same circle, why? 

Physiologists find that after intercourse, male sex hormones will decline rapidly as a protective mechanism. They call this period the refractory period. Naturally, the strong desire displayed by adolescent men before intercourse is caused by high levels of sex hormones. 

This hypothesis of hormonal determinism reveals a cruel reality: neither the rise nor the decline of our desire is determined by ourselves. Everything is a trick played by the Creator, and we are just slaves who blindly obey him.

So in theory, to defend our free will, we should not masturbate at all, and we should resolutely quit this behavior.

But unfortunately, in reality, if you are at the age of high libido. And can't vent it well, the various side effects will emerge.

Therefore, in order to maintain our physical and mental health, the correct approach is: having sex regularly at the time of estrus, if can't , use masturbation as an alternative. The purpose of doing this is only maintaining our hormone levels at a healthy level thus to minimize its impact on our real life.

### The legitimacy of open relationships

Unfortunately, the Creator has more than one trick for us. Another physiological rule is that mammal usually won't maintain high libido for the same thing, which means, no matter how strong the sexual attraction of both partners is. Five to ten years after they continue sex, both parties will lose their desire to have sex with each other. 

There is an even more severe contradiction in modern China. The rising price of the first home has sharply increased the cost of marriage. More importantly, with the popularization of higher education in middle class. Women will not just plainly marry someone in their early 20s as they used to. Both parties were nearly 30 when they got married. This is an embarrassing age: men are about to step down from the peak of their sexual abilities while women are far from that.

In a more extreme example, successful men in the upper class usually marry multiple times, but by then they are close to the end of their sexuality. 

In the video of Liu Qiangdong’s rape case disclosed in Minnesota, sexual intercourse lasted only three minutes ( we call it "一东"). For people of Liu Qiangdong's age, this has already exceeded their average level ( [1雷等于12秒](http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2012-11-29/144725692275.shtml) ). 

It is hard to imagine that his young wife can experience a real orgasm in three minutes, so It is undoubtedly a pity for the long married life. 

In this case, the open relationship becomes a compensation for sex.

Sounds quit reasonable.

### Why I am against open relationship

But if you follow this line of thought, it is obviously wrong.

As we all know, the experience of taking soft drugs may be better than sex. Or, it must be wonderful if you taking soft drugs while having sex. At the same time, in some countries in the world, such as Canada, taking soft drugs, such as marijuana, is completely legal. If the deduction continues like this, then it will be a great pity if you cannot take drugs, or take drugs while having sex here in China. 

Of course we know that this is not the case at all. 

In the development of human society for thousands of years, the living standards of human beings have been greatly improved. Even an ordinary person’s living conditions may be better than that of the emperor hundreds of years ago. (The level of pleasure in sex may not be In this way, but it is completely true in terms of food, clothing, housing and transportation.) So would we think our life is more valuable than the ancients just because we have greater satisfaction in enjoyment? 

Indulging in carnal enjoyment is always the least respectable, and it will probably make you sink continuously, and eventually fall into the endless abyss of desire. On the contrary, things that seem to be diametrically opposed to pleasure, such as self-discipline, temperance and studying are the true necessities of well being.

This is also true in an intimate relationship. If both parties allow each other to go carnal exploration, obviously they will probably reach the deep area of human sin. Needless to say, that is not the good example of well being.

A common counterargument is: Wouldn't it damage your partner's free of sex intercourse if you were against this?

Of course, she has her own freedom of sex, but a very important point in an intimate relationship is that both partners help each other to achieve a better life. Then as a husband, guiding his wife to achieve a good life is one of his responsibility. Many wives indulge their husbands smoking and drinking. I think a responsible wife should persuade her husband to quit them. 

### What I think sex should be in our life

My view looks like an extreme conservative. It's strange that things have changed a lot, and then it turns out that the best answer has already been answered long before. 

People have freedom of sex, but they should not put too much effort on it. Many successful people have come their cropper on sex. The Liu Qiangdong is the recent example. There are also countless professors who have lost their reputations and positions for seducing their students. If they choose a faster way, such as masturbation or prostitution ( I think the sex trade is immoral, but it is better than raping girls ) things may be much better.

Sex should be a dispensable embellishment of life, not a goal. The life goal of many young man become to make money and buy a big house, so they can marry a beautiful young wife（For this goal, they would rather give up all principles, such as bombing countries across the ocean to the sky）I don't know why the spirit of the zeitgeist corrupted like this, but just by saying it, you know that this life goal is absurd.

### Racial discrimination in sex

I always believe that having sex with others freely is our fundamental right. In other words, it is her own freedom for a Chinese girl to have sex with people of any race. The choice of personal sexual preference cannot be a reason for any moral condemnation.

If we believe that using a single-headed masturbation stick or a double-headed masturbation stick is a completely irrelevant detail, then why does having sex with a  black instead of with an Asian become a serious matter of principle?

Many feminists have analyzed that this is because Asian men’s inborn disadvantages in sexual abilities have caused them to develop low self-esteem, and then frantically attack domestic women who have sex with other races.

Many sex experts object to this. Their reason is that the pleasure of sexual intercourse has nothing to do with the length of the penis, only the technique of intercourse is matter. Another point of view is adopted by women who have a lot of experience in sex, that is, the most important factor in the pleasure of orgasm is the hardness of the penis. Because everyone's sex skills are usually comparable.

Another analysis shows that Asian men are anxious that their sexual resources are shared by people of other races. This is actually also very absurd. Even if no foreigner is in China, young and beautiful girls will choose those who are stronger and richer.

The solution is, as I said, to put sex on a dispensable position in life, so you can focus on doing more important things, such as exploring science and philosophy, doing good things, and improving family life.

When 何伟 was teaching in Fuling, like other foreign friends, he was seduced by many local women, but he did not choose to make his rich sex life part of his trip to China, which I think is just a wise select that many people can't realize.



## 谷歌翻译：讨论开放关系

### 前言

我今天早上读了一篇关于开放关系的[文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZzeE5NgNdsxMPpFan9wr7g)。

老实说，尽管我已经阅读了很久以前讨论过的相关概念，但我仍然对这个概念感到震惊。

在齐泽克（Zizek)的一次演讲中，他讨论了有关开放性关系的一些道德问题。 但是我认为他只是在简单地谈论它。 我猜对于一个像Zizek这样老胖的丑陋男人来说，很难找到令人满意的性关系。

可能有点长而混乱，所以我做了一个索引。



### 我的性经历

毫无疑问，我几乎没有性经验。

尽管我很小的时候就接触过色情制品（其中大多数是小说和图片）（感谢互联网），但我始终将它们视为艺术品和文化产品。在这种情况下，情节和表达的含义是最重要的部分，最终目的不是射精。

当时，我认为性在人类生活中具有不可替代的地位，对性的压制是非常反人类的，刻板的，不合理的。

但是（一年前）开始手淫之后，我对性的态度发生了180度的变化。

（好吧，您可能想知道，您为什么这么晚才开始自慰？大多数青少年在您这样的年龄就已经开始了第一次性行为。更奇怪的是，您说您接触色情内容的时间如此之早，但您从未自慰过，那简直是难以理解。

实际上，有时候情况确实如此怪异。在我看到的所有色情作品中，没有一个描述男人如何自慰。

当然，这件事从来不靠别人教。有一些观点指出，人们天生就有一定的冲动，冲动会引导您完成所有步骤。

另一个非常重要的原因是我出生时患有血液类疾病。在该疾病手册中的“性与死亡”一章中说：

> 俗话说：疼痛是最好的避孕药。 当然，并非总是如此。
>
> 在医生的指导下，患有XXX病的人仍然可以正常性生活。
>
> 您应严格遵循以下规则：
>
> 1. 性交前一小时静脉注射XXXml XXX甾醇产品。 XXX甾醇产品的确切含量是根据附录III中指定的公式计算的。
>
> 2. 尽量避免激烈的性活动和对心脏的过度压力。
> 3. 如果慢性疼痛影响勃起，请提前服用止痛药。
>
> 等等



因此，即使我有一些边缘自慰行为，当我接近性高潮时，我总是觉得它太激烈了，以至于我的理智占了上风，并告诉我必须停止。

当然，当我足够大的时候，我发现那根本没问题。这本小册子虚张声势。 ）

### 我对手淫的看法

当我开始自慰时，伴随着极大的乐趣，随着欲望的消退，我对我以前的性观点进行了哲学上的反省。

一言以蔽之，我们感到的欲望和愉悦是完全不合理和荒谬的。我讨厌这个。

这只是上帝在我们的基因中设计的一种机制。它没有任何意义，也不可能包含任何意义，您只要按一下鸡巴上的一个按钮，性高潮就来了。

这是没有意义的，浪费时间，但是人们只有在达到性高潮之后才意识到这一点。几天后，他将继续同一个循环，为什么呢？

生理学家发现，性交后，作为保护机制的男性性激素将迅速下降。他们称此时期为不应期。自然，青春期男人在性交之前表现出的强烈欲望是由高水平的性激素引起的。

荷尔蒙决定论的这一假设揭示了一个残酷的现实：我们的欲望的兴衰不是由我们自己决定的。一切都是造物主的伎俩，我们只是盲目服从他的奴隶。

因此，从理论上讲，为了捍卫我们的自由意志，我们根本不应自慰，而应坚决放弃这种行为。

但不幸的是，实际上，如果您正处于性欲高涨的年纪。而且如果不能很好地发泄，各种副作用就会出现。

因此，为了维持我们的身心健康，正确的方法是：在发情时定期做爱，如果不能做爱，则可以使用手淫作为替代。这样做的目的只是将我们的激素水平维持在健康水平，从而将其对我们现实生活的影响降至最低。

### 开放关系的合法性

不幸的是，造物主不止一次耍了我们。另一个生理规则是，哺乳动物通常不会对同一件事保持较高的性欲，这意味着，无论对方的性吸引力有多强。他们继续发生性关系后的五到十年，双方都将失去彼此做爱的欲望。

在现代中国，矛盾更加严重。第一套房的价格上涨大大增加了结婚成本。更重要的是，随着中产阶级高等教育的普及。女人不仅会像过去那样简单地20出头就嫁人。结婚时，双方都快30岁了。这是一个令人尴尬的时代：男人将要从性能力的顶峰下台，而女人则远非如此。

在一个更极端的例子中，上层阶级的成功男人通常会结婚多次，但到那时他们已接近性欲的尽头。

在刘强东在明尼苏达州披露的强奸案视频中，性交仅持续了三分钟（我们称之为“一东”）。对于刘强东这个年龄段的人来说，这已经超过了他们的平均水平（1雷等于12秒）。

很难想象他的年轻妻子会在三分钟内经历一次真正的性高潮，因此，对于漫长的婚姻生活来说无疑是一个遗憾。

在这种情况下，开放的关系成为对性的补偿。

听起来很合理。

### 为什么我反对开放关系

但是，如果您遵循这种思路，那显然是错误的。

众所周知，服用软性毒品的经历可能比性生活要好。或者，如果您在做爱时服用软性毒品，那一定很棒。同时，在世界上一些国家（例如加拿大），服用软性药物（例如大麻）是完全合法的。如果这种推导继续下去，那么如果您不能在中国这里吸毒或在做爱时吸毒，那将是非常可惜的。

当然我们知道事实并非如此。

在人类社会几千年的发展中，人类的生活水平得到了极大的提高。甚至一个普通百姓的生活条件也可能比数百年前的皇帝更好。 （性生活中的快乐程度可能不是这样，但就食物，衣服，住房和交通而言，这是完全正确的。）因此，我们会认为我们的生活比古代人更有价值，只是因为我们更会享乐？

沉迷于肉体的享受永远是最不受人尊敬的，它可能会使您不断堕落，并最终陷入无尽的欲望深渊。相反，似乎与乐趣截然相反的事物，例如自律，节制和学习是幸福的真正必要条件。

在亲密关系中也是如此。如果双方允许彼此进行肉体探索，显然他们很可能就会触碰人类罪恶的深渊。不用说，这不是幸福的好例子。

一个常见的反对意见是：如果您反对这样做，是否会损害伴侣的性交自由？

当然，她有自己的性自由，但是在亲密关系中，非常重要的一点是，双方都可以互相帮助，共同改善生活。然后，作为丈夫，指导妻子过上好日子是他的责任之一。许多妻子放纵丈夫吸烟和饮酒。我认为有责任心的妻子应该说服丈夫戒掉它。

### 我认为性生活应该在我们的生活中的位置

我的观点看起来非常保守。事情发生了很大变化，这很奇怪，然后事实证明，最好的答案早就已经被回答了。

人们有性自由，但不应为此付出过多努力。许多成功人士都在性生活上栽了跟头。刘强东就是最近的例子。也有无数教授因引诱学生而失去名声和职位。如果他们选择更快的方式，例如手淫或嫖娼（我认为性交易不道德，但比强奸女孩更好），情况可能会好得多。

性应该是生活中可有可无的装饰，而不是目标。许多年轻人的人生目标是赚钱并购买大房子，以便他们可以娶美丽的年轻妻子（为此，他们宁愿放弃一切原则，例如轰炸大洋对岸的国家）不知道为什么时代精神如此衰败，但是只要说出来，就知道这个人生目标是荒谬的。

### 性别上的种族歧视

我一直认为，与他人自由发生性关系是我们的基本权利。换句话说，中国女孩与任何种族的人发生性关系是她自己的自由。个人性偏好的选择不能成为任何道德谴责的理由。

如果我们认为使用单头自慰棒或双头自慰棒是完全不相关的细节，那么为什么与黑人而不是与亚洲人发生性关系会成为原则问题呢？

许多女权主义者分析说，这是因为亚洲男性天生具有性能力方面的劣势，导致他们自卑，然后疯狂地攻击与其他种族发生性关系的家庭妇女。

许多性专家对此表示反对。他们的理由是，性交的快感与阴茎的长度无关，只有性交的技巧才是问题。拥有大量性经验的女性会采用另一种观点，即，性高潮最重要的因素是阴茎的硬度。因为每个人的性技巧通常都是差不多的。

另一分析表明，亚洲男人担心自己的性资源被其他种族的人们共享。这实际上也是非常荒谬的。即使没有外国人在中国，年轻漂亮的女孩也会选择那些更强壮，更富有的人。

正如我所说，解决方案是将性置于生活中可有可无的位置，因此您可以专注于做更重要的事情，例如探索科学和哲学，做善事以及改善家庭生活。

何伟像其他外国朋友一样，在涪陵教书时，被许多当地女性引诱，但他并没有选择将丰富的性生活作为他前往中国之旅的一部分，我认为这是很多人做不到的明智的选择。
