## One dream

France, political conflict between our nation and black people? I don't remember.

The embassy is going to fall, ambassador hire some workers from mainland for ￥100,000 a month to ensure security, lots of money!

Accept an interview from CCTV, the ambassador says: I commanded immediately……that the taxes paid by the people should given back to the people, exactly?

ZhuJun and DongQing laughed for several minutes.

Over.

Speaking of which, I always cherish the old design language of simulacra style, and the texture of fake aluminum which all disappear in the new vision of macOS.

What a shame!

## The C Programming Language

Finish reading.

Actually the appendix part is the most useful part of the book, but I don't know why, that part is awfully written, really awfully, basically the worsted document I have ever read. 

It tried to explain an idea with about 70 lines of plain text. Yes, plain text, no code or diagram!

## Learning Web Design

Fuck！watching videos to learn is 100 times faster that reading those shit books！

I wish I could realize it two weeks ago...
