## Dream

Snowing days, I was hanging out with my friend.

My friend: "I wonder when this epidemic will pass. I've been stayed at home for almost one year."

I: "That's ok, some of my friends came back from EU and US, they may encounter more trouble than us."

At that time, a huge ship passed by ( I don't know but we seems walk around the harbor ) I pick up my iPhone and start to shoot.

My friend: "That is ridiculous. Why you take photos since you know exactly this is a dream, you won't be able to review them in reality."

I: "Well, don't say that silly words. Photography is an attitude, a process of pursuit, not a result. 

If I donâ€™t need to take photos in my dreams just because I can't check them in reality, why do people take photos while they are alive if they know that they will ultimately die and won't be able to check their photos in the next life? Besides,  I may check them in my next dream. "
