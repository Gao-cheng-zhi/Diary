## Dream

Is about spring festival, I was going on a vacation with my grandparents.

A girl happened to send me a message and asked me if I wanted to start a relationship.

You know I always make bad decision on these affairs, but this time I rejected her instantaneously.

Mobi is shit, why people invent this kind of format?

I waste tons of time converting them into epub.

## Atomicity[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_normal_form&action=edit&section=4)]

> [Edgar F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd)'s definition of 1NF makes reference to the concept of 'atomicity'. Codd states that the "values in the domains on which each relation is defined are required to be atomic with respect to the [DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBMS)."[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form#cite_note-CoddAtmReq-7) Codd defines an atomic value as one that "cannot be decomposed into smaller pieces by the DBMS (excluding certain special functions)"[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form#cite_note-CoddAtmDefn-8) meaning a column should not be divided into parts with more than one kind of data in it such that what one part means to the DBMS depends on another part of the same column.

> [Hugh Darwen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Darwen) and [Chris Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Date) have suggested that Codd's concept of an "atomic value" is ambiguous, and that this ambiguity has led to widespread confusion about how 1NF should be understood.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form#cite_note-Darwen-9)[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form#cite_note-DateConf-10) In particular, the notion of a "value that cannot be decomposed" is problematic, as it would seem to imply that few, if any, data types are atomic:
>
> * A character string would seem not to be atomic, as the RDBMS typically provides operators to decompose it into substrings.
> *  would seem not to be atomic, as the RDBMS typically provides operators to decompose it into integer and fractional components.
> * An [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN) would seem not to be atomic, as it includes language and publisher identifier.
>
> Date suggests that "the notion of atomicity *has no absolute meaning*":[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form#cite_note-DateNoAtm-11)[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form#cite_note-Date2015-12) a value may be considered atomic for some purposes, but may be considered an assemblage of more basic elements for other purposes. If this position is accepted, 1NF cannot be defined with reference to atomicity. Columns of any conceivable data type (from string types and numeric types to [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) types and table types) are then acceptable in a 1NF table—although perhaps not always desirable; for example, it may be more desirable to separate a Customer Name column into two separate columns as First Name, Surname.



Oh fuck, finally understand why I always get confused about it.

You guys define such shit definition and test us with all kinds of strange and tricky exams. 

## 196X

> He used the strong current to float downstream and emerge on the other side of the river an hour later, ‘with ruddy cheeks and buoyant spirit’. The news was broadcast all over the country, squashing rumours about his health. ‘He showed no sign of fatigue,’ the papers gushed, comparing the wind and waves to the black storm kicked up by imperialists, revisionists and reactionaries: China would triumphantly ride it out. Photos showed the Chairman standing on a boat, dressed in a robe and waving his hand. Mao penned a poem to mark the occasion. ‘I care not that the wind blows and the waves beat; it is better than idly strolling in a courtyard.’



"the papers gushed" is a nice metaphor.

Ever since I watched a porn where girl in it shouted "GUSH ! ! ! " during orgasm, I couldn't face this word anymore⁄(⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)⁄.

His work seems like creating by a European photographer.

That is exactly what I was worrying about...
