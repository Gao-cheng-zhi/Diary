## No dreams today



## Kaguya-sama~

I really feel that I should not follow this series......

It's just bad taste.

## Latex

Ok, zhenxiang

I'm finally back to use Latex to write that fuck Academic garbage.

Because word is shitttttttttttt!

I don't know why but when my file size reaches a certain point, like 15 Mb, the preview just gets non-live.

That means if you want to scroll from page2 to page23, you have to wait for about 5~6 s to get it done, and its feel like PPT! About 3 fps I guess？

You may say: that is because your computer is shit, Mac can't run office quit well.

But when I send my docx to my father's surface laptop, something even more shit happened: All the formats completely get messed! You know I have speed many time to get it displayed right on my computer!

Not even mentioned that it get even lower fps when you scroll through the page!



So I decided to turn to the  latax, at least its format with the same in various computers.

I set my mind to download the full version of latex, I used to play it with a basic version of tex about 14 MB in size.

Amazing right? but that means you have to deal with all kinds of bugs, it is almost useless unless you only read&write English in the very basic mode.

This time I decided to download the full version of tex, which is about 10 GB! Shit!

But the good thing is all bugs disappeared, you don't have to configure all kinds of json files to get it right, it just works!

And the even better things is that you no longer feel like PPT, it responses your movement instantaneously, and you don't have to think about format. it is done automatically for you!

One thing I want to mention: to all Mac users who wants to use latex in their computer: just use vscode! don't use texpad, not even mentioned someone has paid for it ($20?) That software is totally shit, it's not even done. But consider that is a 23 MB software 

## Css

Update my website.

Css is shit!

It looks totally different on different machine!

I think I have to learn it again......



Just for learning, I download a css from a very simple website of Microsoft……and it end up to be
