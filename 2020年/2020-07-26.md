## Dream

Bought a Chanel wheelchair. 

It's all silvery, and it runs very fast without the need for any enenrgy.

I "drive" it on a highway, crushed against a truck.

Dead.

## Django

VScode supports really well for python.

I just need to continue press the tab key, and the autocompletion will do the rest of work, it's so smooth, I don't even need to think.
