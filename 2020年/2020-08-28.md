Why lady's beautiful legs are so attractive to men?

 It doesn't make any sense.

When I walk around the school, dining in the dining hall, picking books in the library, I just can't help to glancing at those thin white legs walked by, Why?

In theory, those are just limbs. cow legs, dog legs, no differences. 

This is really annoying. My reason and sense tell me not to look at these things, but I always observe the around involuntarily. When I see those beautiful legs, I can't look away, making me like a hentai. 

God, this is not my intention!

I kind of doubt whether there is free will.

## Campus close

Unfair! Why those primary school kids could come and go without any prevention?

## Castration can cure baldness

Interesting, because the reason why people are so care about baldness is mainly because it make people lose their sexual attraction.
