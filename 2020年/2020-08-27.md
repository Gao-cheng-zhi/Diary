## Train

Too many people in the station, no green code check at all. 

Ironically, wearing masks shut the facial recognition systems down, so they just skips it.

## De Profundis

Finished reading on the train.

I thought it wouldn't end so quickly. I was at the page 165 and the book have 256 pages. But they just stopped, the rest of them are the appendix of those quotations

## 疫情下的轨道交通出行

没有任何区别！

They put a lot of people standing there, and a lot of code for us to scan, but I didn't scan any of them and I just go my way, no one stopped me.

There were a few times I really thought I was going to get stopped and scan something or show somebody my green code: many people gathered together in a port and seems were writing something, but I just went round and nothing happened.

In most situation the guard just stood there looking the flow of people come and go.

## KFC

KFC one yuan donation is a bad design, they put the "Yes" and "No" button the exactly the same size.

I don't even realize it before I hit the "No" button.

Why KFC in different places have different menu?

## Cleaning

Not so bad, but the quilt is quit a problem.

## Elevator

It has been 8 mouths the last time I took an ad-free elevator.

Everything is so clean and simple.
