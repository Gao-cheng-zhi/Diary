## Dream

Another *Cubic* like dream.

We, three women seven men, were stuck in a huge building where food and other necessities were automatically generated every day.

In order to get out, we have to solve three puzzles in the meeting room.

The first one is about LInk-List, pretty easy.

The second one is about B+ tree, hard, but we eventually solved it.

The third one is about optical measurement, logically I thought it was unsolvable, but we made a wild guess and it passed.

Unfortunately, we didn't get out within the given time. So we have to solve another 3 puzzles the next day.

What's worse, our phones are out of charge one by one. It was really anxious for a modern man to live without his phone. We don't even know how to get out without Google map!

"That's why they give us some red candles." One of my friends said.

"Oh, these candles are scary. They reminds me of some poor horror film" I said

The next day came. We open the metal box and find the three puzzles are significantly harder than the previous one.

The first one is about the memory allocation in sys management.

I won't tell you what the second one is because we spend the entire day to solve the first one and don't even look at the second one.

We create an extraordinary complex pattern but still can't solve it. All of us felt desperate。

……

"Candle times now" One of my friends said.

"Oh, damned, we may never get out" I said

"Probably" Another friend said.

"So, why don't we just fuck each other and have some fun? I mean instead of trying to get out, why don't we just live here and wait for the system to collapse itself? They provide us so many delicious food and we don't even taste it. We spend all our time to solve those unsolvable puzzles! It's fucking silly!" I said.

"Well, for the obvious reason, if your proposal is accepted, there may be some allocation problem, which may not be easier than the one we trying to solve. And what makes man differs from barbarian is that we don't just accept our destiny on earth, we believe in God and manage to go to the heaven, otherwise, what is different between stuck in this building and stuck on the earth?"

> 最后一个学期的文学课上，我们学习了华盛顿·欧文、埃德加·艾伦·坡、马克·吐温、凯特·肖邦、杰克·伦敦、罗伯特·弗罗斯特，以及兰斯顿·休斯的文学作品。学到最后一个单元的时候，我布置他们在课外阅读谭恩美以及其他几位美籍华斋诗人的作品。对学生来说，文学课的主题一开始显得遥不可及——瑞普·范·温克尔、跳跳蛙①，以及兰斯顿·休斯笔下那些遥远的大江大河。可突然之间，我们看到了影片《喜福会》的结局，美籍华斋作者谭恩美以故事叙述者的身份来到中国，见到了她的姐妹们。这是中国这个元素第一次正儿八经地进入我的文学课。学生们曾经以中国特色表演过莎士比亚的作品，改写过罗宾汉来到中国的故事，但这一切都不过是在他们习以为常的文化背景下硬生生地学习外国文学课程。至此，我们终于来到了这个阶段：故事的叙述者紧紧地拥抱着她失散多年的姐妹们。所有女生都哭了，男生则大多在强忍着泪水。



学英语还得来涪陵师专（笑）
