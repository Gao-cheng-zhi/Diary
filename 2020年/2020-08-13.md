WTF this book is trying to talk about?

It describes the whole ideal of full stack development concept in Chapter 9, with only 24 pages! 

How could people with no background understand those things? 

## NottinghilWedding

I saw this company's ad on WeChat today. I have to say that I was impressed by its photography and would like to find out how much each wedding costs since my sister is going to have a wedding soon.

The customer service lady wouldn't even talk to me, WTF???

And I saw their price list on the internet, oh, about ￥1,000,000 and only available in Changzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou ( Why? )

The customer service lady's choice is right.

……

Any way I saw some of their wedding ceremony live, it was pretty shit actually. The reason why their ad was so impressed is just because there were no people in those scenes, once the ceremony was filled with ugly ( sorry ) people, nothing could help.
