## Dream

Hunger game.

Two sides, each 8 people. One team armed with machine gun, another armed with nothing.

I was in the nothing team.

But we eventually make it, killed all 8 people, women included.

That is immoral. One shouldn't kill anyone in any case, especially women.

But what should I do at that situation?



##Serf

Every time I feel lonely and sad I always comfort myself with the example of serfs: many things we complain about nowadays are just moaning whinge-bags. 

Think about that: If you were born 500 years earlier, chances are you're just a serf, working in the field for entire life.

You have nothing, you don't even know how to read!

That is horrible!

But what if you were born 500 years later? What will people in that era think of our life now?
