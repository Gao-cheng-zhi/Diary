## Telegram

After heard his founder's story, I feel really puzzled: Why could such thing exist in such a damn worldï¼ŸIs that because this world is indeed with rule of law and carrying out the innocence inference? Even if some European countries can, Russia and Iran could obviously conduct an international arrest warrant. Or another assumption is politicians&some big names around the world also uses it for convenience.

Another thing that surprised me is that telegram is a small but elite development team, only 12 people, all world-class programming champions. Truly, some times more people just caused more chaos. A good programmer is 1000 times faster that a normal one, and the normal one usually damaged your overall architecture.
