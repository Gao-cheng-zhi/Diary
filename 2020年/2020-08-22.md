## Dream

1. A Captain Pig (real pig) lost all his limbs during a fight with a group of wolves, but he also earned the reputation of being a hero. He conquered the rest of the wolves into slaves, tied them up his pirate ship and sold them to the barren plains of East Armenia.

2. Captain Pig's pirate ship succeeded in fighting with the Royal British Navy. The key to success is that the former black deserter is now the main gunner of the enemy ship. He didn't forget the old friendship of Captain Pig. He made some tricks and sank the British flagship. Finally returned to Captain Pig’s pirate ship and reunited with her old lover Marry · Su.

3. While chatting with others, I accidentally clicked the report "traitor" button below, but in any case I couldn't type the complete Chinese characters to explain to the police lady, because all the keys on the keyboard have been remapped. You will never know what you've typed.



## Dinner party

A bunch of old drunks get together again.

Oh fuck, the man on my left probably has a negative EQ, all kinds hate him.
